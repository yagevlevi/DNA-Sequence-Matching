# DNA Sequence Matching

Task: Build a program that will read two sequences from the user, a base and a target, with fixed lengths (20 and 5 respectively). It will then compare these 
sequences looking for “overlap” and if it finds the overlap, it will print out that a match has been found and a resulting sequence. Otherwise it will indicate 
that no match was found.

Summary of Tech Stack: This project was done entirely in C and the emphasis was put on the use of Loops, Functions, and Arrays.
